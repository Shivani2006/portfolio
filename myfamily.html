       <h3>Mother:</h3>
       <img src="./images/mother.jpg" width= 300 height= 300 >
       <p> My mother is the reason I attend this class and I am so grateful for that.
           She is a really creative cook, a good best friend and always supports me in whatever I do.
           And the only flaw she has is,she gives too many lectures </p>

       <h3>Father:</h3>
       <img src="./images/father.jpg" width= 300 height= 300 >
       <p> My father is the most intresting person in our family.
           He always helps me in my studies and teaches me new tricks to learn the concepts better,
           he is also very sporty and he is the one who inspires me to stay fit.
           My father can be the most intresting as well as a very sleepy person </p>

           <h3>Brother:</h3>
       <img src="./images/shivesh.jpg" width= 300 height= 300 >
       <p> My brother is the most playful person in the family.
           He makes me laugh throughout the day and keeps the whole family entertained.
           He can be the clown of the house as well as the spy of the house(complains)
            </p>

           <h3>grandmother:</h3>
       <img src="./images/grandmother.jpg" width= 300 height= 300 >
       <p> My grandmother is the power control of the house as she manages everything in the house
           from households to droping and picking us up from school and classes.
           Even though my parents work I would say my grandmother is the most hardworking person in our family.
           My grandmother can sometimes become my mom who bosses me around.
         </p>

           <h3>grandather:</h3>
       <img src="./images/grandfather.jpg" width= 300 height= 300 >
       <p> My grandfather is the most caring person in the house.
           He never lets us skip a meal and makes sure we eat our heart content.
           He also buys us whatever we ask for and gets us something tasty every day for us to eat after school.
           My grandfather is sweet unlike my brother but he does not take things seriously exactly like my brother! </p>
